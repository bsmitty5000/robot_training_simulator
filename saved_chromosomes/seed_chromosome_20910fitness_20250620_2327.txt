first ever chromosome that makes it the entire course!

couple of subtle bugs were sabotaging me:

1.  i was pulling the width and height values from the json and swapping
    them, so the coverage grid was inverted. this allowed some robots
    to have coordinates outside the bounds of the coverage grid. and i
    didn't double check chatGpts version of coverage checking closely enough
    because there was a check to make sure the robot was within the grid
    boundaries for safe indexing, but there was no 'else' statement to catch
    if the robot was outside the boundaries. so some robots were stuck or 
    spinning but able to rack up huge keep alive rewards
2.  i finally figured out why the robots had a hard time turning right but not
    left- i was starting them at (75,75) because the first wall started
    at y = 150. but the course boundary has a width of 10, which meant the
    robot was actually starting 65 pixels from the top boundary and 75 pixels
    from the first wall. once i changed to start at (80,80) so it's an even
    distance of 70 pixels from each wall right turns were no longer a problem
