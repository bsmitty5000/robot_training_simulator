this chromosome is the best of 500 generations of 1024 individuals
it exhibits incredible obstacle avoidance like all of the best
now and it can stay incredibly straight on the straightaways, but
it can't turn at all, and i'm not sure if it's right turn onlys or what.
it seems once it hits a wall there's a point where the sensor inputs
and the controller outputs stabilize.

again i think something is off with how i'm
currently rewarding/punishing behavior.
