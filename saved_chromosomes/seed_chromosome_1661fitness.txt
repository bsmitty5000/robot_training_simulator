this chromosome is the best of 5 generations of 256 individuals
it exhibits incredible obstacle avoidance like all of the best
now, but it's able to navigate turns much better than the current
higher fitness chromosomes. the only issue is on left turns it seems
to miss any new openings and instead completely turns around. then
when it gets to the other end, which is now another left turn, it
does the same thing.

i think something is off with how i'm
currently rewarding/punishing behavior.
