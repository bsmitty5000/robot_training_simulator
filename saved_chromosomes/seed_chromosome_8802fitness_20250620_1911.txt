This is made with 500 generations of 1024 individuals.

Many tweaks to the fitness rewards:
  * jitter penalty is stil 0.1 but i was looking at the actual
    value's and they're in the 10^-5 range so this is never going
    to make much difference unless the penalty multiplier is huge
  * clearance reward is now calculated as by taking the average
    of all the sensor readings, normalizing by the max range,
    and multiplying by the reward multiplier
  * new cell reward is now 50 for each new cell. i figure it's so
    novel to find a new cell since cells are as large as the
    robot compared to keep alive reward
  * keep alive reward is halved, so each time step contributes
    1/2 a point
  * added a new timeout penalty that just wipes away any keep
    alive points that were accumulated while stalled

when i visualized this one it almost made it all the way!
somehow it got confused on the last left turn, i think b/c
that one is different since the clearance is smaller there
